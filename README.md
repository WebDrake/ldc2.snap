ldc2.snap
=========

This project defines a snap package for LDC, the LLVM-based compiler for
the D programming language.

The LDC project aims to provide a portable compiler for the D language,
with modern optimization and code generation capabilities.  It uses the
official DMD compiler frontend to support the latest version of D2, and
uses the LLVM Core libraries for code generation.  For more information
on LDC, see: https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc

The D programming language is a systems programming language with C-like
syntax and static typing.  It combines efficiency, control and modelling
power with safety and programmer productivity.  For more information on
the D language, see: https://dlang.org/

Snap packages are designed to provide secure, containerized applications
that are appropriately sandboxed away from the rest of the system they
are running on.  For more information on snap packages, see:
